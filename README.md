# The Power of Deep Reinforcement Learning in Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Bladder Cancer

This repository contains the code for predicting clinical outcomes for bladder cancer patients using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. The study utilizes the TCGA-BLCA dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.

## Code

The main code file is `BLCADRL.py`, which includes the implementation of various policy strategies such as EpsGreedyQPolicy, GreedyQPolicy, BoltzmannQPolicy, and MaxBoltzmannQPolicy.

## Getting Started

To run the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To execute the script, use the following command:

```bash
python BLCADRL.py
```

## Results

The outstanding performance of GreedyQPolicy, with an average reward of 410.56 and a maximum reward of 412.00, showcases the potential for optimizing clinical decision-making processes.
